# ⚠️ NOTICE: This project is no longer being maintained.
This fork is no longer maintained and may have bugs. Feel free to fork, however no pull request or bug report will be answered.  

Sincerest apologies, but we no longer have the time to maintain this fork. We strongly encourage anyone who needs this to find alternative solutions to the VFX Graph on the builtin pipeline.


# What's this?
This repo is a fork of Unity's VFX Graph v10.3.2, back porting features from the later versions of the VFX Graph.

The only reason for this is because the VFX Graph does not officially support the built-in pipeline, and v10.4.0+ removed support for the builtin pipeline all together.

As we have some built-in pipeline projects that make use of the VFX Graph, it is useful to keep this around locked to this version. Apparently it still works with Unity 2021.1.13f1, though obviously there's no guarantee how long this will keep working for.
